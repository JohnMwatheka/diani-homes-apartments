          <h3>Diani Beach</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Diani Beach is a beach on the Indian Ocean coast of Kenya. Diani Beach is located 30 kilometers south of Mombasa, in Kwale County. Diani Beach is about 17 kilometres (11&nbsp;mi) long, from the <strong>Kongo river</strong> to the north and <strong>Galu beach</strong> to the south (the southern point of reference is an old Baobab tree). Diani is one of the most prominent tourism holiday resort areas of Kenya. The indigenous people of the Diani Beach area are the Digo, one of the nine ethnic communities known as the Mijikenda. Today the area includes Kenyans of various ethnicities who have migrated to Diani, drawn by the tourism related economy. With a population of over 100,000 inhabitants, the Diani/Ukunda urban area is one of the largest at the Kenyan coast and forms part of the larger Mombasa metropolitan region. A small airstrip - Ukunda Airport - is located between the beach area and the Mombasa-Lunga Lunga Road. The water remains shallow near shore, with some underwater sandbars near the surface which allow wading with a clear view of the sandy bottom. The 16th century <strong>Kongo Mosque</strong> is located at the Northern tip of Diani Beach, where the <strong>Kongo River flows</strong> into the ocean separating Diani beach from Tiwi. It is the last remaining ancient Swahili structure in Diani. Flowing from Shimba Hills, the <strong>Kongo River</strong> forms an estuary as it enters the Indian Ocean. Slowly cruise upstream on a traditional dug-out canoe as you birdwatch among the mangroves and enjoy the serene surroundings. Watch the enchanting sunset then ride back to the beach for some drinks and/or snacks as you enjoy the time with your friends and/or family on the Diani beach. The ride to the <strong>Kongo River</strong> takes&nbsp;about 30 minutes or less. The whole tour lasts for about 2 hours. While Diani Beach has been an increasingly popular tourist holiday destination for most of the 21st century, it has only been accessible by road through Mombasa using the Likoni Ferry.&nbsp; The completion of the Dongo Kundu Bypass Highway (a.k.the <strong>Mombasa Southern Bypass</strong>) is expected to further boost the local tourism sector. Our fully <strong>equipped watersports</strong> center offers you the chance to enjoy a range of water-based activities either on your own or under the guidance of our expert instructors.
